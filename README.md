# ExtensibleMessageBroker
ExtensibleMessageBroker pulls a data from one place (a data source) and pushes it to another places (targets).

You can create as many data source providers and target providers as you want, then simply copy them to the root directory and ExtensibleMessageBroker will import them with **Managed Extensibility Framework**.
